# Day 1 – Start With Outcomes, Not Tools

## Problem
Most data pipelines start with tools instead of defining what “good data” means.

## Step 1 – Outcome
- Who consumes this data?
- What decisions depend on it?

## Step 2 – Structure
Raw → Curated → Consumption

## Step 3 – Failure Modes
- Pipelines succeed but data is wrong

## Step 4 – Decisions That Matter
Design for correctness first.

## Real-World Notes
Most incidents start with unclear outcomes.
